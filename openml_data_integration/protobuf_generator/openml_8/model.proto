// Beginning of Description of Dataset:
// **Author**: BUPA Medical Research Ltd. Donor: Richard S. Forsyth   
// **Source**: [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Liver+Disorders) - 5/15/1990  
// **Please cite**: 
// **BUPA liver disorders**
// The first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption.  Each line in the dataset constitutes the record of a single male individual. 
// **Important note:** The 7th field (selector) has been widely misinterpreted in the past as a dependent variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable rep
