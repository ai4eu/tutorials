// Beginning of Description of Dataset:
// **Author**: Dominique Van Cappel, THOMSON-SINTRA  
// **Source**: [KEEL](http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=105#sub2), [ELENA](https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/neural-nets/Research/Projects/ELENA/databases/REAL/phoneme/) - 1993

// The aim of this dataset is to distinguish between nasal (class 0) and oral sounds (class 1). Five different attributes were chosen to characterize each vowel: they are the amplitudes of the five first harmonics AHi, normalised by the total energy Ene (integrated on all the frequencies): AHi/Ene. The phonemes are transcribed as follows: sh as in she, dcl as in dark, iy as the vowel in she, aa as the vowel in dark, and ao as the first vowel in water.  
// ### Source
// The current dataset was formatted by the KEEL repository, but originally hosted
