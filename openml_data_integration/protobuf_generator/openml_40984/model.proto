// Beginning of Description of Dataset:
// **Author**: University of Massachusetts Vision Group, Carla Brodley  
// **Source**: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/image+segmentation) - 1990  
// **Please cite**: [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/citation_policy.html)  
// **Image Segmentation Data Set**
// The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor images. The images were hand-segmented to create a classification for every pixel. Each instance is a 3x3 region.
// __Major changes w.r.t. version 2: ignored first two variables as they do not fit the classification task (they reflect the location of the sample in the original image). The 3rd is constant, so should also be ignored.__
// ### Attribute Information
