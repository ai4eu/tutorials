// **The Monk's Problems: Problem 3**  
// Once upon a time, in July 1991, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the 2nd European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three MONK's problems.
// The target concept associated with the 3rd Monk's problem
