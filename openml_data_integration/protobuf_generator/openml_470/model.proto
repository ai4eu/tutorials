// PRO FOOTBALL SCORES  (raw data appears after the description below)
// How well do the oddsmakers of Las Vegas predict the outcome of
// professional football games?  Is there really a home field advantage - if
// so how large is it?  Are teams that play the Monday Night game at a
// disadvantage when they play again the following Sunday?  Do teams benefit
// from having a "bye" week off in the current schedule?  These questions and
// a host of others can be investigated using this data set.
// Hal Stern from the Statistics Department at Harvard University has
// made available his compilation of scores for all National Football League
// games from the 1989, 1990, and 1991 seasons.  Dr. Stern
