### training example 
The training example consists of 4 nodes, with each residing in its own subdirectory:

* The core is of course the News-Classifier 
* The News-Trainer
* The Tensorboard node for diagnostics
* And the News-Databroker

Apart from demonstrating a training scenario, this example shows also the use of a shared folder for common file access for pipeline nodes
